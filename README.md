BDD IDE is a simple and powerful Java based editor tool which can help anyone who is looking into automate the test scenarios using predefined step definitions

Below are some of the features of this tool:
  - Add/modify step definitions
  - Parameterize the step definitions so that while adding it to the feature file, user will know exactly what to change(WorkInProgress)
  - Create feature files
  - Suupport to edit multiple feature files at once
  - search for any existing step definition with simple find functionality(WorkInProgress)
  - Search for scenarios with keywords and export it to notepad(WorkInProgress)

Since this is a maven project, user can just download and import this project to start working, and for now, user can only use the MetaData.xml file to add/update the step definitions, in future versions, we will add support to create new meta files through tool.
